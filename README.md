### Hey there

I'm Caio, a Backend Software Engineer focused on building reliable APIs, scalable services, and well-structured systems.

I primarily work with **Go** and **Python**, developing RESTful APIs, background workers, and asynchronous systems.  
I also have experience across different layers of the stack, which helps me better understand system design and product requirements as a whole.

Most of my work is built from scratch, with an emphasis on performance, maintainability, and clean architecture.
